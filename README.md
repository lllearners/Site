# Site
!!!Url name subject to change!!!

Website made by yours truly to be used as a project log and hopefully help me retain my new knowledge on web development.
Creation was very fun and I am very proud with the design and look.
I tried to use the least amount of available web code as possible and tried to restrict myself to reference only. 
I did end up breaking this rule using the copy text code.

Things to improve: 
- organize css classes and attempt to limit the amount of classes created.
- improve on naming scheme (make names more consistent, use widely known elements rather than custom named ones).
- fill up empty space on the right side of the website (I kept it open just incase I wanted to add something else).
